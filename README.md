# Ideas
Noting down some of the ideas that we think could have practical implications. 

1. Hand Gesture Based Translator
This could be a  device to communicate with deaf and dumb people. It could translate hand gestures to language and vice versa. 

2. Professional Services for hire
I personally face this issue where I find it difficult to get trust worthy and reliable house hold help. 
Why not create an open source platform to register, get IDed and reviews tracked.. 

3. Interview helper
app to help me get through an interview. I havent seen a good companion app so far.. 

4. An app that gives me suggestion on things I can do based on my interest + events in my locality.. 

5. An app \ solution that helps me to ensure my kid is always safe. 
I am always worried about my families safety. But at the same time I done want to keep them on a short lease. 

6. An Augmented reality app that will try to provide information on a person when looking at them (kind of like the terminator movie)

7. Physical world as a database: I need a way to interact with physical entities via some means. 
Eg: Select a "tea shops" near me && order a tea 
Or: Issue command to my washing machine: Run at 10-11 PM tonight
I want to see if we can stansdardize or write an adaptor that can translate my commands to this entity. 

8. Ability to track expiry dates of items that we buy and intimate when it nears expiry. When I am eligible to claim warranty. Ability to get\scan digital receipts.
